Luther
======

Project Luther was our second project at the bootcamp. The goal was for us to learn and implement a regression problem. For my project I used Metacritic.com as my data source to gather aggregated critic reviews for all movies released in the past twenty years. I then created a ridge regression model which predicted average IMDb movie rating based on that movie's cast, director, genre and critical reception.
